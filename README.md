# NftMetadataIndexerSystems

## Description

A repository showcasing a novel NFT metadata storage solution leveraging IPFS content addressing with a Merkle tree-based on-chain index for verifiable data integrity and reduced gas costs for minting.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple EVM-compatible chains using a configurable block ingestion pipeline.
- Provides a GraphQL API for querying NFT metadata, including ownership, attributes, and historical transactions.
- Implements a caching layer using Redis to minimize database load and improve API response times.
- Supports advanced filtering and sorting options within the API, such as filtering by trait rarity and sorting by price.
- Deploys a distributed architecture with horizontally scalable indexing workers for handling large NFT collections.
- Utilizes IPFS pinning services to ensure long-term availability of off-chain NFT metadata.
- Generates real-time alerts for suspicious NFT activity, such as wash trading and rug pulls, using machine learning models.
- Integrates with decentralized storage solutions like Arweave to archive NFT metadata and prevent data loss.
